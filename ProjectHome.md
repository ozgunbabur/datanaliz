This project brings several biological-data access, conversion, and analysis tools together. It features:

**Gene Expression Omnibus:** Access with GSE ID. The tool downloads and parses the dataset. Select rows using Gene Symbol, Entrez Gene ID, GenBank ID, or Spot ID.

**CCLE:** Access to Broad-Novartis CCLE expression dataset. Select specific cell line groups derived from the same tissue type.

**Conversions:** Convert between Gene Symbols, Entrez Gene IDs, and HGNC IDs.

**Simple statistics:** P-value for Gaussian and Binomial distributions. Student's t-test. Significance of mutual exclusivity and co-occurrance. Histogram.

**File handling:** Parser for delimited data files.
